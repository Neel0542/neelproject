        <p class="p">Remington enjoyed a good reputation in the U.K. We did have a few at school but I really don’t remember much if anything about them. I seem to remember that I preferred an Imperial 66 for some reason. When I saw a Quiet-Riter going for auction I was sorely tempted. I tend to spend quite a lot of my time typing into the early hours and I thought that a quieter typewriter might make the natives a little less restless. I have had this machine now for over a year and I wasn’t going to write a quick review of it since I was sure that there must be many others since it had been a popular typewriter in it’s day. The reviews that I have seen tend to give more of a potted history than really telling you anything about what they are like or how they are to type with. I often read a review if I can find one of anything I am going to buy, especially before risking the odd £5 on a typewriter! Usually, it’s just that they are good machines but never tell you why.</p>
    
        <p class="p">My one is c.1955 and was owned by a well-known politician, now in the House of Lords and later by a famous Formula 1 racing driver, Robert Walker who later became a motor sport journalist who from the mid seventies and also had an Olivetti. I have the Olivetti too! All I can say is that it is a pity they did not take more care of the typewriter. It is working well now but it has been dropped at least once during its lifetime. It has also taken a right royal hammering over the years judging by the deep marks left by the letter strikers on the key basket. However, these typewriters are well-engineered and are built a proverbial battleship. Writing any sort of review on such a ‘vintage’ machine can be difficult as you really need to know how they were when new and not after half a century of abuse. I am fairly confident that my Quite-Riter types just as it is supposed to do now that it has had a jolly good clean and service.</p>
    
        <p class="p">Okay, now I know that these Remington typewriters are much loved or remembered by many but to anyone not used to them they are just a little quirky. You may well wonder what the miracle is about the ‘Miracle Tabulator’ or the magic in the ‘Magic Margin’ either come to that. Changing the ribbon can be a novel if not fraught an experience to the uninitiated or those without a manual! For a start they have spooless ribbons and back in the day all you got was the ribbon in a tin with a metal insert. They are however easy to do. These Remington typewriters ae certainly different if nothing else. The Quiet-Riter, Office-Riter and Letter-Riter are all very similar machines but the letter version has no tabulator and the office has no sound insulation. Apart from that most of this review applies to all three typewriters. These machines are called portable but like many produced in the 1950’s are pretty bulky and rather heavy, semi portable would be a better description, The quality of build is the same as the larger office machines and every bit as capable too and they tended to replace the older upright machines in many offices.</p>
    
        <p class="p">`SPECIFICATION: Well, we should be in for a real treat here if Remington’s advertising hype can be believed. It does have pretty well all the bells and whistles you would expect on better quality typewriters but don’t bother looking for a paper rest because unbelievably, it does not have one! Neither does the paper bale have a graduated scale on it, an unusual omission and one that I miss. The carriage lock is a small lever on the bottom of the right hand side of the carriage locking the carriage securely in both directions. Remington claimed that the typewriter always loaded the paper squarely into the machine first and every time which it does. Just as well as the paper release lever is a fiddly little thing on the right end of the carriage. There is another lever just the same on the left of the carriage which will permit the platen to freely revolve for line drawing when boxing in rows of figures and such with a pen on a tabulation. Two levers on the top left and right hand side of the release the carriage so you can move it left and right. The folding carriage return lever is shaped for the left finger, a nice touch there and another fiddly lever under the carriage return to select 1, 2 or 3 lines at a time. Much was made by Remington about the paper bale which could be pulled forward instead of just being lifted up and there is a neat tag screwed into the right of the paper bale to facilitate this.  What the point of this feature is I haven’t a clue. You might have thought that they would have put a graduated paper scale on the paper bale like most machines but no, they didn’t. There is the usual paper scale where the paper is loaded and two in front of the platen on the carriage itself in the usual Remington fashion. The top of these is, for the most part obscured but the lower one can be clearly seen looking through the hole beneath the ribbon vibrator. The ‘magic’ margins are set by the two sliding tabs behind the paper scale on the carriage as it is on many typewriters.</p>
    
        <p class="p">PERFORMANCE: One thing that will be liked by quite a few is that when using the shift key, the key basket goes down which is often less effort than a carriage lifting machine. On most machines the backspace key is on the right but on this one it is on the left. I did find myself hitting the tab key instead of the backspace key at first after using another machine. Most of the things you will soon accustom yourself to though. Not everyone likes to type on these Remington typewriters, some complaining that they are slow and tiring to use, yet the keyboard is not particularly steep, less so than many of the upright office machines. They do have a light (touch control?) cushioned feel when touch typing which you either like or dislike but I doubt is the average two-fingered typist will notice that a lot. The first thing I notice about the Quiet-Riter is that it isn’t very quiet!  To be fair it is quieter than many machines but my Erika Pullman has sound deadening material under the cover too, no hype and a lot quieter as are a few of my other typewriters. It is certainly a lot quieter than the Silver Reed machines though. I do tend to type a bit more slowly on the Remington but then it is that sort of typewriter that feels comfortable jogging along at 40 w.pm and not many would type much faster than that all day long in an office.</p>
    
        <p class="p">CONCLUSION: It’s all very 1950’s in style and I rather like the shiny green colour too! It’s probably my age but for  me it has a sort of comforting feeling and I sort of feel at home with it. It is, however, very much a Marmite machine, loved by some and hated by others. For some it is a slow, stodgy feeling typewriter with some annoying things like the awkward levers but for others, well, it’s all very nostalgic (romantic?) and very Remington! It’s hardly the holy grail of typewriters and I wouldn’t swap it for my Erika, Olympia, Adler which are all better typewriters. If you have more than one typewriter I would try one before you buy it if possible, they’re not for everyone. If it’s your first machine do make sure it works okay, trying to sort out problems on these machines is not for the faint hearted. It is a robust and well engineered machine and it is also a thumping great heavy lump to lug around, portable is a matter of opinion.</p>
